# On Demand Accessibility API
This repository acts as a public feedback/bug tracker for ODA API (www.oda-api.com).

There are only a few rules for creating issues here:
- You must be a user of ODA API (and github of course).
- You must be respectful to all other users.
- Please label your issue as either bug, improvement, new feature, or documentation using Github labels.

What you should report here:
- Bugs
- Improvement Ideas
- New Feature Ideas
- Documentation Updates

Our goal is to provide (in the very least) an acknowledgement of each new issue created.  However, timelines for when anything will be fixed or updated will not be mentioned until it is a certainty.
